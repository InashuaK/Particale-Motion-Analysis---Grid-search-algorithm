# Particale-Motion-Analysis---Grid-search-algorithm
This is a package for performing P-wave Particle motion analysis for shallow shear wave velocity estimation using the grid-search algorithm.
The analyses use scripts/codes written in Bash and MATLAB. Please see PMA_manual.doc for details to run PMA.
